# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Matplotlib
Practicing EDA advanced techniques for exploring and understanding data with: 

1. Univariate Analysis: Use of histograms, boxplots, and density plots to examine the distribution of single variables.
2. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Techniques such as scatterplots, correlation matrices, and pair plots to study relationships between two or more variables.
3. Outlier Detection: Identifying unusual data points using visual and statistical methods.
4. Data Cleaning and Transformation: Handling missing data, normalizing distributions, and preparing datasets for modeling.
5. Visualizing Relationships: Understanding correlations and trends between variables.
6. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.

Data sets analysed: 
1. Divorce Dataset – Analyzes social factors and trends associated with divorce rates.
2. Airlines Dataset – Investigates factors contributing to flight delays.
3. Salaries 1 Dataset - Demonstrates a right-skewed distribution (i.e., most salaries are lower, with a few very high ones)
4. Salaries 2 Dataset - Used after applying a log transformation to the data from Salaries 1(To show how transformation improves visualization and interpretability. Also, normalize the distribution for better statistical modeling or comparison.)
